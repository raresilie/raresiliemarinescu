<I'm RareÈ™ Ilie Marinescu, a PhD student working on ancient philosophy at the University of Cambridge.>

<My research focuses on the reception of Aristotle in the late antique philosopher Proclus.>

<In my thesis, I demonstrate how Proclus rejects or embraces certain Aristotelian insights depending on their perceived (in)compatibility with his Platonist background.> 
<This is achieved by considering the concept of motion and its implications for psychology, cosmology, and metaphysics.>
<Beyond Aristotle and Proclus, I have broad research interests in Plato, metaphysics, cosmology, and the idea of authority in antiquity.> 
<Next to my research, I enjoy teaching undergraduates in ancient Greek and philosophy. I also regularly organise seminars and conferences.>
<Please feel free to contact me about my research or possible collaborations!>
