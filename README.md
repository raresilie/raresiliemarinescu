Hi!

I'm Rare»ô Ilie Marinescu, a PhD student working on ancient philosophy at the University of Cambridge.

My research focuses on the reception of Aristotle in the late antique philosopher Proclus.

In my thesis, I demonstrate how Proclus rejects or embraces certain Aristotelian insights depending 
on their perceived (in)compatibility with his Platonist background. This is achieved by considering 
the concept of motion and its implications for psychology, cosmology, and metaphysics.
Beyond Aristotle and Proclus, I have broad research interests in Plato, metaphysics, cosmology, and the
idea of authority in antiquity.
Next to my research, I enjoy teaching undergraduates in ancient Greek and philosophy. I also regularly 
organise seminars and conferences.
Please feel free to contact me about my research or possible collaborations!
